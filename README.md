# Automatic-Number-Plate-Detection

DETECT LICENSE PLATES WITH TENSORFLOW OPENCV AND OCR LIBRARIES
In the following project, we will recognize License number plates using the Python programming language. We will utilize OpenCV for this project in order to identify the license number plates and the python pytesseract for the characters and digits extraction from the plate. The results have shown that the trained neural network is able to perform with high accuracy of nearly 90-95 percent in recognizing license plates.
